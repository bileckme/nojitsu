# Description:   System of nothingness
# Paradigm:      Spirit of nought. No thought. No code. No blame. No fault.

# This script should be the helper executable script that reverses and cleans up system structure created by generate.
# It should be able to perform elementary tasks such as deleting a folder and deleting a file
# 
# The below example shows how the platform project was created:
#
# rm -rf /sandbox/system
# rm -rf /sandbox/repository
# rm -rf /sandbox/framework
# rm -f /sandbox/system/README.md
# rm -f /sandbox/system/TODO.md
#
# See tests folder for demonstrations
